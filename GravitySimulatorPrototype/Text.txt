never initialize float in this way :- 1/60 ;
always do it in this form :- 0.1666f ;

always i repeat ALWAYS check if its *= or *

------------------------------------------

no need for normalizing vectors as your slready just adding and subtracting vectors with directions

dont worry about speed you fast af boi !

vectors always copy

std::move actually just moves despite what gpt might tell you the og place will just be a nullptr
use unique_ptr they are goated and more versatile
u can just -> on a unique_ptr
